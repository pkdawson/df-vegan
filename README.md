A few tweaks are required to make vegan dwarves completely practical in Dwarf
Fortress. This mod adds cloth quivers and backpacks, which can be made at a
Craftsdwarf's workshop, using the Clothesmaking skill.

I'd also recommend turning off artifacts (strange moods), which often demand
bone or other animal products.
